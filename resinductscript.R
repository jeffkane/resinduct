#### Resin Duct data processing ####

# This code will take TXT files built from the measurement of resin ducts in ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/)
# and process them so that the final output will be a CSV file containing 5 resin duct metrics
# corresponding to calendar years in which the ducts were formed. It is assumed that RWL files of
# ring widths have previously been created using standard dendrochronological techniques and that
# sample IDs match those of TXT file names.
# For further detail, refer to the associated paper (Hood et al., in prep).

# There are FOUR individual sections that follow. Each can be run separately but may require a file type
# output from a previous section. Each section should be run in its entirety for best results. 

# The sections are as follows:
# 1. ADDING YEARS TO RESIN DUCT METRICS - add years to resin ducts measured in ImageJ following protocol in Hood, S. M., C. C. Reed, and J. M. Kane. 2020. Axial resin duct quantification in tree rings: A functional defense trait. MethodsX 7:101035.
# 2. COMBINING INDIVIDUAL CSV FILES INTO ONE FILE - combines all .csv files created in previous section into one file with all trees of interest
# 3. CALCULATING UNSTANDARDIZED DUCT METRICS - calculates resin duct metrics that have not been standardized by ring area
# 4. CALCULATING STANDARDIZED DUCT METRICS - uses data from unstandardized metrics created in previous section combined with existing .rwl files to calculate resin duct metrics standardized by ring area

#### 1. ADDING YEARS TO RESIN DUCT MEASUREMENTS ####

# This section takes a .txt file of resin duct measurements exported from ImageJ and assigns years based
# on the initial year of measurement. Protocol for measuring resin ducts in ImageJ is as follows:

# 1. Start with inner most ring of interest (closest to pith) and note year of ring formation
# 2. Measure all ducts within one annual ring before inserting a "zero" to denote ring boundary; continue this system for each ring
# 3. If a ring HAS resin ducts that have been measured, ALWAYS insert a "zero" after measuring ducts within that ring
# 4. If a ring DOES NOT HAVE resin ducts, simply insert a "zero" and move on to the next ring.
# Further detail on measuring protocol can be found in Hood et al., in prep


# User defined variables - CHANGE THESE:

# script should be re-run from here for each .txt file

#### 3. CALCULATING UNSTANDARDIZED DUCT METRICS ####

# This section takes the .csv file produced in the previous section and calculates three resin duct metrics
# that have not been standardized by duct area:
# Total duct area: Sum of duct area per annual ring (mm^2 / year)
# Duct size: Mean size of all ducts per annual ring (mm^2)
# Duct production: Total number of ducts per annual ring

# User defined variables - CHANGE THESE:
file_location <- "C:/FILE_LOCATION"     # set the location of CSV file created in previous section
file2 <- "test.csv"     # name of .csv file created in previous section
newfile2 <- "unstandardized_metrics.csv"     # name of .csv file that will be created in this section with unstandardized duct metrics

###

# Main script - should not need to change:
setwd(file_location)     # set directory
data <- read.csv(file2)     # read in .csv file created in previous section
data <- subset(data, data[,3] != ".")     # remove breaks between years

# calculates: total duct area (TDA), mean duct size (size), duct production (prod)
temp_tda <- aggregate(data$Area, by = list("SampleID" = data$SampleID, "Year" = data$Year), FUN = sum)
temp_size <- aggregate(data$Area, by = list("SampleID" = data$SampleID, "Year" = data$Year), FUN = mean)

fun1 <- function(x) {     # counts number of rows, unless a 0 value, which returns 0
  if (x != 0) {
    length(x)
  } else {
    0
  }
}

temp_prod <- aggregate(data$Area, by = list("SampleID" = data$SampleID, "Year" = data$Year), FUN = fun1)

# put all metrics into one data frame; convert TDA and size to mm since ImageJ records in inches
duct_metrics <- data.frame("SampleID" = temp_tda$SampleID, "Year" = temp_tda$Year,
                           "Total_Duct_Area" =  temp_tda$x*645.16, "Duct_Size" = temp_size$x*645.16, "Duct_Production" = temp_prod$x)

# if no ducts were produced in the sampled portion of the ring, then a duct size of 0 would
# falsely decrease average resin duct size because almost surely ducts exist elsewhere in the ring,
# therefore duct size cannot be 0 and is replaced with NA:
duct_metrics$Duct_Size[duct_metrics$Duct_Size==0] <- NA

write.csv(duct_metrics, newfile2, row.names=FALSE)

### NOTE: The metrics calculated above are UNSTANDARDIZED, i.e. they have not been standardized by
# ring area. One result of this is that rings with ring width = 0 will not be differentiable from
# rings with 0 ducts (i.e. both will be shown as having 0 area). 
# The following section includes the code for calculating standardized metrics given that the
# width of the core is known and a ring width file (.rwl) containing the same sample IDs exists.

#### 4. CALCULATING STANDARDIZED DUCT METRICS ####

# This section uses data from unstandardized duct metrics calculated in previous section combined with
# existing .rwl files for the same trees to calculate two standardized resin duct metrics. The output file
# includes all 5 resin duct metrics as well as corresponding ring widths (mm) and ring areas (mm^2). It is
# assumed that the sample ID ("Sample") for each tree is the same in both .rwl files and .csv file with
